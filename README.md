# AgOpenGps_kalman
THIS IS THE MODIFIED FILE FOR ADDING A KALMAN FILTERING TO HEADING CALCULATION OF AOGTREE, THE FILTER IS VELOCITY BASED. 
This means that the filtering will be greater at reduced speed or equal to 0 and will cancel itself as the speed increases. It is very useful in case the IMU is not used to stabilize
the fix to fix heading which would otherwise cause the orientation to rotate continuously.
